1. Is the circuit receiving current from me?

   Yes, current will flow through the circuit as long as the battery is not dead and the switch is in the on position. The current can be determined using Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL), which states that the total current flowing into and out of a junction must be equal.

2. The battery provides the power.

   The diagram's label indicates the 12V DC (direct current) that the battery provides. Based on the information given, we are unable to calculate the wattage or amperage.

3. What happens to the current flow in the circuit when a 12-watt lightbulb is turned on?

   When the 12W bulb is opened, no current will pass through it; this suggests that the filament is broken and that there isn't a continuous path for current to flow. The other two bulbs will keep glowing as long as there is current flowing through the circuit and both are working as they should. This makes sense because the bulbs are wired in parallel.
