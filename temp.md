1. Respect Allah and His Prophet at all times. Don't take action without taking their lessons into account. This maintains our humility and awareness of heavenly direction.
1. Verify the information before spreading or believing anything you hear from someone you don't trust. This lessens the chance of miscommunication and injury.
1. All believers are like brothers and sisters. If a dispute arises, assist in finding a peaceful solution. This maintains the community's compassion and cohesiveness.
1. Never make light of or offend other people. Respect is due to all. As a result, the atmosphere is friendlier and more respectful.
1. Avoid drawing unfavorable assumptions about people, spying on them, and speaking poorly behind their backs. It's equivalent to consuming your brother's flesh. Honor the dignity and privacy of all people. By abiding by these guidelines, we can live a better, more moral life and become closer to Allah.
